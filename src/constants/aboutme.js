export const aboutme1 = `I discovered my passion for programming while building websites for small tech companies in Ethiopia during my Bachelor's summer break. It was a volunteer project, but it sparked a fire and set me on a path to a programming career. Soon after graduation, I landed a job at a company where I tackled a MERN stack project, which solidified my decision to pursue this field further. This experience ultimately led me to Sweden, where I was fortunate enough to be part of highly skilled software engineers. I was part of a team responsible for over twenty microservices running on a GCP Kubernetes cluster managed by Terraform. While there, I actively learned and worked on new cutting-edge technologies. I also participated in an on-call rotation shared with the DevOps team.`
